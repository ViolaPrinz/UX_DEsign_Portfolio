      <p>Hy, I’am Viola and I’am a creative UX designer. My background is in arts of different kind, so I’am trained to be steadily creative and innovative. Through working in the market to sell my art, I gained great skills in customer service.                                                                                                   Through Careerfoundry I gained a lot of experience and know how about the UX design process.                          I am a passionate problem solver, who loves to inspect problems in depth. My attitude is friendly and open minded towards humans, so my goal is to understand people and to make them enjoy, while conducting user research. I like to explore actual design trends and to use them in combination with the individual project and it’s unique process and goals.                                                                                                                                                     Furthermore, I will learn about Web Development and UI design, so that I can collaborate easily with teammates and to also code high fidelity prototypes.
